        <h1>Mochi Images</h1>
        <p>This page covers common image formats.</p>

        <h2>JPGs</h2>
        <p>JPG images are good for displaying photos without increasing file size by sacrificing some detail through compression. However, they don't allow for transparent pixels.</p>

        <img src="../images/mochi.jpg" alt="mochi ball" width="75">

        <h2>GIFs</h2>
        <p>GIFs are the go-to for animations, but are limited in color palette thus preventing a high-level of detail.</p>

        <img src="../images/mochi.gif" alt="mochi ball bouncing" width="75">

        <h2>PNGs</h2>
        <p>PNGs are great for anything that's not a photo or animated such as a logo or diagram as they include a higher-level of quality and allow opacity.</p>

        <img src="../images/mochi.png" alt="high quality mochi ball" width="75">

        <h2>SVGs</h2>
        <p>SVGs are vector-based images compared to pixel-based images above so that means they can scale up and down in any dimension without losing quality and should be used in place of PNGs as often as possible.</p>
