    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Adobo</strong> is one of Philippines's most iconic dishes. With a flavorful umami highlighted by marinated chicken thighs and bay leaves, a Filipino party is never complete without this delicious dish to feed the masses!</p>

    <p>Easy to prepare, the key ingredients to giving this dish its sweet and flavorful taste are: soy sauce, brown sugar, vinegar, garlic, and pepper corn. This dish is best served over white rice.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken thighs</li>
        <li>Pepper corn</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>Bay leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'm a firm believer that cooking is not an exact science so my best advice in terms of proportions for the ingredients is to place as much meat as you want and experiment with the portions for the sauce to customize it to your liking. </p>
