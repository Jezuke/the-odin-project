    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Adobo</strong> is one of Philippines's most iconic dishes. With a flavorful umami highlighted by marinated chicken thighs and bay leaves, a Filipino party is never complete without this delicious dish to feed the masses!</p>

    <p>Easy to prepare, the key ingredients to giving this dish its sweet and flavorful taste are: soy sauce, brown sugar, vinegar, garlic, and pepper corn. This dish is best served over white rice.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken thighs</li>
        <li>Pepper corn</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>Bay leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'm a firm believer that cooking is not an exact science so my best advice in terms of proportions for the ingredients is to place as much meat as you want and experiment with the portions for the sauce to customize it to your liking. </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the chicken by mixing the soy sauce, vinegar, brown sugar and chicken in a large bowl. For optimal flavor leave in fridge overnight.</li>
        <li>Cut potatoes into small cubes and pan fry till tender. Set potatoes aside.</li>
        <li>Dice garlic and fry in a large pan till golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and saut√© for a bit then pour marinated sauce and a enough water balance the flavor. (I advice tasting the soup every few minutes to gauge taste)</li>
        <li>Add bay leaves, pepper corn and brown sugar.</li>
        <li>Mix and let simmir for 30-ish minutes or until chicken is cooked</li>
        <li>Add potatoes back in and simmer till soft to liking.</li>
        <li>Serve with rice, my personal addition of fried egg.</li>
    </ol>
