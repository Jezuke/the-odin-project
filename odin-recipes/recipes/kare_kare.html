    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Kare-kare</strong>. A dish that I loved as a child, despised as a teenager, and fell back in love with as an adult. This stew is rich in flavor from its base ingredient: <em>peanut butter</em>. As a child I enjoyed this dish and it was common in to have it at least once a week in my household, however, when I found out it was made out of peanut butter all of a sudden my appetite for this dish vanished. I was the type of kid who absolutely despised pineapple on pizza and fruit with hearty dishes, so it just didn't sit right with me that peanut butter should be mixed with meat. But through the years I once again fell in love with this dish.</p>

    <p> As I became more open to complex flavors and an appreciation of ingredients as a medium for food, that there was no right or wrong way to mix ingredients (debatable), I began to appreciate the rebellious nature of certain ingredients in creating an absolutely delicious meal. There's a lesson to be had in this I guess... Things that don't fit the puzzle at first may have just been oriented wrong as was my perspective on this dish's composition originally.</p>
